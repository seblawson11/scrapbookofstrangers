When looking for ruby-red exotic fruit the temptation is to walk into a supermarket and pick out the already extracted, ready to go, pomegranate seeds. They may not be cheap but at least we don’t have to go through the process of extracting them ourselves. Supermarkets run off this mantra. But it is a question we should further consider - should we spend our precious time to deseed a pomegranate or fillet our fish if someone else, or a machine, will do it for us?


In its entirety, the pomegranate is unashamedly slow to prepare; extracting the seeds is not as simple as peeling a banana, but rather one should cut it in half and then bang profusely on the thick outer layer with a wooden spoon, allowing the seeds to infrequently escape into a bowl. There may be others ways to do this, but the point is that there is a ritual attached. This rituals feels a velvet rebellion from the very supermarket you bought it from, where the equally tasteful deseeded version always sits tantalisingly close to the entrance. The rebellion being that food should not always be about vitamins, discounts and convenience; nor should it necessarily be about taste.


Food is about connection: connection with each other, but also with the food itself. By this I mean that food is a bridge between ourselves and the planet, a moderator of holistic living. The more abstract and distant the food feels from its origin the less connected we may feel to the planet. It is no surprise that ancient civilisations had such evocative meaning for their food because to them it was miraculous, perhaps divine, that something growing from the earth could also provide such nourishment. In the Old Testament the pomegranate represents the fertility of the promised land; the fruit itself was so special that it had come to represent something much greater than a healthy snack. It can be difficult to understand this from a dingy supermarket aisle where they sit in plastic baskets next to all the other exotic fruits, a fry cry from the tree from which it came.


At risk of being considered crazy you don’t have to ascribe symbolism to each of your fruits, however when you are banging the back of the pomegranate with a spoon you may well feel how lucky it is that this weird fruit exists and can be grown on a few patches of this little planet of ours. It may make it taste a little sweeter, it may make us waste a little less.
