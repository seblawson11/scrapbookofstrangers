The return of the milkman/milkwoman is not about nostalgia, it is instead an unorthodox lesson about progress itself. It has very little to do with milk itself.



This re-emergence shows progress is not necessarily linear, nor is progress synonymous with change. We can safely say that society moves forward in a much more exciting way than the predictable passing of time. The milkman theory shows that society is built upon a random series of experiments that rely not only on human ingenuity, but also a collective humility to admit that some changes may not be for the better; time being the best judge. We can only hope that progress does manifest itself somewhere beneath the great trial and error of our history. By definition we have never done what is new – so how would we know if it is good for us? We have never been where we have been so we can only hope we are moving in the right direction. The unpredictability of the future is enshrined in the milkman’s second coming. We shouldn’t want it any other way.



What this may also do is change our approach to history. It is now not just a viewing gallery for progress but may instead be a source of remediation for the present. We should remember that it is our modern hatred of plastics that has rekindled the milkman’s career. An old means has been used to partially solve a new problem.



In terms of the present, the milkman theory may make us more cautious over new things, the so-called benefits of change may be treated with a little more scepticism. Perhaps we will soon decide Hellenic architecture should make a comeback, or that travel should once again consist of irregular but longer, more adventurous voyages by train. What the return of the milkmen shows us is that not all that fades is lost.



The milkman story encourages us to learn from our past, to be forgiving of our present and to be optimistic about our future. All this and it gets delivered right to your door.
