"I had a great thought in the shower just now" is something we hear or say surprisingly often. We should all wonder why this joyous regularity may be the case.

To most a shower is nothing more than a practicality. It is used to cleanse ourselves and perhaps an attempt to heat us up or cool or us down. Yet all of us will be aware of another benefit of the shower – shower thoughts. These are not normal thoughts that we have in an office or around a dinner table; they are a deeper, more creative brand of thinking. They are also for the most part entirely unintentional. If we were to label the shower as our thinking box then it might become less enlightening than if we simply treated it as a means of washing ourselves.

It is when our mind is most at rest and we are not specifically trying to think that we may ironically have our best, most perceptive thoughts about ourselves and that which exists beyond the shower cubicle.

These branches of thought tend to occur when we remove ourselves momentarily from the distractions of the world. Going for a walk to get some fresh air, bathing to relax, or showering to wash can all have some pleasant unintended consequences through the provision of revealing thoughts. The lesson here may be that we should never put too much pressure on our own mind. When we put the brakes on a bit we can paradoxically be at our most productive. We all know that post-shower ecstasy when we’ve just had a great, entirely unprovoked thought.
