Sure, freshly painted nails have that same alluring chemical aroma as petrol fumes. And sure, they scream refinement and thoughtfulness when you’ve gone to the trouble of matching your varnish with the exact same shade as your dress/tie/waistcoat/rebellious hair dye. And sure, when properly filled in without any gaps, they’re about as satisfying as a lid of unbroken yoghurt peeled from your morning Activia. But no matter how immaculately you paint, no matter how many layers you apply, they’ll never look as good as when they begin to flake.



There’s something about the way nails flake that reminds me of mortality. Maybe that’s too morbid, too French, but there’s a something so deliciously poignant about the decay of nails done either as a means to alleviate boredom or to attract another soul. It’s all destined to crumble into fragments of dried nothingness eventually, just as we too are bound for such an end. In some ways then I suppose we might be considered the varnish, non? After all, we’re born smooth, glossy, untainted, but as time passes we start to wear. We grow scarred and scuffed by the grinding routine of our daily lives. We become a shadow of our young, former, sparkling selves, and yet we remain defiant in facing our inevitable decline.



And we’re all the more beautiful for it.
