Unfortunately a lemon is now too cheap and too ubiquitous to be considered exotic, and yet it utility is never-ending– it can dress fish, add citric notes to hummus or sharpen a dessert. But where their greatest source of pleasure may lie is as an addition to the most basic of human necessities – water.

Sure Limoncello is ok in small quantities, homemade lemon juice can of course be more bearable than its sugary supermarket cousin. But where the lemon comes to the beverage fore is as a slice in some ice cold water. As the bulbous interior of the lemon slowly releases its fragrance the water is transformed into not just necessity, but something much more desirable, exotic, less remedial. It is just a small change to satisfy our desire to stretch beyond necessity. It is in its most basic form what distinguishes the human from other life. Would we see a dog add a slice to their water bowl? They certainly wouldn't write about it.

The imports of the fancy restaurant seldom make their way to the home kitchen, and yet a slice of lemon in water has managed to make the leap through the unobtrusive way it can make our most essential fuel taste just a little better; a disproportionate improvement in the quality of water compared to the negligible cost of a fraction of a lemon. It is enough of a change to be the right amount of not very much.
