Give them to me cheap and bendy: cheaper and bendier the better. Give them to me with deeply tanned pages the colour of lacquered wood, so that I can tell they’ve been thumbed through in the heat of the midday sun, on Andalucían beaches or besides glistening azure pools tucked up in the folds of Tuscan hills. Give them to me with inscriptions written in blunted pencil: happy birthday, anniversary, graduation — or just your classic love note. Give them to me with a marker lost in the maze of words, or the exoskeleton of a curious fly embalmed on page 116. Give them to me with coffee rings accidentally highlighting a non-descript passage, or a scribbled reminder of which character is which on the blank page between the title and acknowledgements. Give them to me with little tears, folds, and creases in the spine.



Let me see all of the stories that have followed the story within. Let me see how intimately people have held them, how desperately they have sought comfort in their worlds. Let me be the bearer for a while, and add my own touches, before passing it on. For what else do we hold so dear, so intensely, and yet are so willing to share with strangers?
